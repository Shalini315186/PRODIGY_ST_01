# ðŸ§® PRODIGY_ST_01 â€“ Calculator Functional Test Cases

This project contains a well-documented set of 27 manual test cases for a basic calculator application.  
The test cases are designed to verify the functionality, reliability, and accuracy of arithmetic operations.

It covers all essential operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
Additional scenarios include decimal operations, negative numbers, division by zero, and input with special characters.

The test cases also validate calculator behavior for BODMAS rules, parentheses, and long expressions.  
UI-related functionalities like Clear, Backspace, and repeated `=` operations are also included.

Each test case outlines clear **preconditions**, **test steps**, and **expected results**.  
This project can be used for manual QA testing, academic practice, or as a base for automation scripting.

All test cases are organized and saved in a text file (`Calculator_Test_Cases.txt`).  
Itâ€™s ideal for beginners, testers, and developers working on calculator-based applications.

Created as part of the PRODIGY_ST_01 training task for learning structured test design.
